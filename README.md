This repo contains the assignments for EURECOM's compmeth course.

# Overall Objective
In this course we gain experience in “digital” processing on high-performance computing architectures. From the perspective of an algorithm, we firstly look at its performance under arithmetic constratings, resulting primarily from finite-precision arithmetic. 
Then we examine means to optimize computational performance

Several practical sessions are detailed here in the form of assignments covering areas such as:

- Numerical methods for characterizing the performance of a fixed-point FFT algorithm
- Software Frameworks for real-time computing using SIMD on x86 (AMD/Intel) and aarch64 (Nvidia Grace / Ampere Altra)
- Nvidia-based frameworks for GPU/DPU including CUDA and DOCA
